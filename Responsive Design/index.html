    <h1>Gaming Consoles of the Past</h1>
</div>
<div>

    <h2>The Atari 2600</h2>

    <p>
        Gaming consoles have been around for quite some time now. One
    of the first major gaming consoles that started it all was the Atari
    The Atari 2600 was released on September 11th, 1977. This was one of the
    first systems to use cartridges allowing the user to play many different games,
    older versions could only a few games that were built into the console.</p>

   

    <p>
        When the Atari 2600 was launched the price was $199.00 and the console
        only sold 250,000 units. The Atari 2600 had about 400 games once said and done.
        at the time this was an amazing feat, however this would eventually be
        the downfall of the Atari 2600. With so many games out and no real advancement
        to the technology people grew tired of the same old format.

    <h2>The Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)</h2>

    <p>The Next Major console to come out and change the face of gaming was the
    Nintendo NES. Nintendo became very popular after the release of this console.
    Nintendo worked on it's console in secret and made sure to be far ahead of it's competitors
    with it's technology in order to keep a firm grasp on the market. After a few
    hic-ups Nintendo ended up selling 2.5 million consoles.</p>

   

    <p>Nintendo had many popular games in arcades that were eventually ported over to the NES
    Nintendo's main competition was Sega but they never quite over took Nintendo. Systems of this
    time period mostly used cartridges to play games. Nintendo changed the gaming by having a
    more interactive system and a controller with more options than the old joystick and single button.</p>


</div>


<div>

    <h2>Nintendo 64</h2>

    <p>Nintendo held the gaming industry for many years, when they created the N64 they changed everything again for
    the gaming world. Switching the processor from 8bit on the Nes to 64bit on the N64 hence the name.
    this processor improvement led to a whole new world of options. The main improvement was the graphics. This
    allowed 3D designs to be used instead of 2D flat designs in older games. This system still used cartridges to play
    games but these games held a lot more space and had more power available.</p>


    <p>At this point in time Nintendo had a rich history and many popular games, they built off of these tried and true games
    and re-made them or made sequels that kept the masses coming back for more. Nintendo held the crown for household gaming for many years
    until consoles evolved and started to use discs instead of cartridges. The major hit to Nintendo's
    dynasty was the Sony Playstation.</p>

</div>


<div>

    <h2>Sony Playstation</h2>

    <p>The New generation of gaming came to light with the Sony Playstation. Playstation still used a 64bit system, however they switched from the old
    cartridge style games to discs this allowed for much more information and game play available. Although Sony was a newcomer to the
    console world they had many popular games and grew quickly. With the disc style games Sony could create games on multiple discs that had over 100 hours of
    game play available. This generation of console had a very strong run and lasted nearly 10 years and over 100 million units.</p>

    <p>At this period in time game consoles were in nearly every home. They were no longer a commodity for just the rich but now the average family could have access to a console
    with the success of Sony's first console they looked to the future and how to improve on their first generation of consoles. The only thing that could take down the Playstation was it's
    own younger sibling that came to be the Playstation 2</p>


</div>


<div>

    <h2>Playstation 2</h2>

    <p>With the success of it's first console Sony decided to keep it's presence in the console world and created the Playstation 2.
    The new version of Playstation stuck with the disc type of game but improved on the processing power changing from 64bit to 128bit this change brought a new generation of
    3D graphics and allowed for much smoother textures for game play. At this point in time Sony had almost complete control over the gaming market and that was okay with the masses of
    gamers. Although it was not the only company at the time producing consoles it far dwarfed any competitors companies like Nintendo were still around but could not hold up to the power
    and status of the Sony's Playstation 2. Another great feature of this console was the ability to play certain games online with other players. </p>

    <p>Eventually a established computer company decided to enter into the console world. This company is known as Microsoft. Sony released it's Playstation 2 in 1999 and had quite a bit of a head start over
    Microsoft's Xbox which was released in 2001. Although these two consoles were much alike, Xbox ended up with a slight advantage over the Playstation 2 because it had a lot more online games available to play,
     this led to an ensuing war that continues today the main competitors these days are Sony, Microsoft, and the nostalgic Nintendo.</p>


</div>


<div>

    <h2>Xbox</h2>


    <p>Microsoft's Xbox came a few years after the Playstation 2, this gave Microsoft access to newer and better preforming technology.
    Although Xbox was still a 128bit system Microsoft had greatly improved the online aspect of gaming, they also had games that were only published
    for their console. With these two advantages Microsoft's flagship console was battling sony head to head for the industry lead. The availability of online games
    was a huge seeling point for Xbox and because of this all consoles today have online game play.</p>

<div id="The_Future">
    <h1>The Future</h1>

    <p>With systems having built in features like blu-ray and the option for Netflix or other streaming services, the future looks bright
    for gaming. Over the years technology keeps improving and the market keeps growing. In 2014 alone the gaming industry generated over 70 billion dollars
    revenue that is a huge improvement from the past. Statistics show that more adults are playing video games now also, games are not just for kids anymore.</p>
